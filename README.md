1. **Performance**: in number of CPU cycles spent per byte generated,
   on N2 GCP instances. On N2D (AMD), the order is the same.
2. **Quality**: level at which it fails PractRand. We show a `>` if it did not fail.
   We put a question mark if we have not proved it.
3. **Seed correlation**: PractRand on interleaving of bytes from eight streams
   with seeds 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
   We use PractRand with folding 2 and expanded tests.

On the subject of seed correlations, the `./bin/sample-seed-fingerprints.sh` program
highlights additional anomalies:

- RC4 has weak seeds with heavy artefacts visible in the fingerprints.
- RomuTrio's fingerprints start with the same first character for all seeds.

## Commands

- `make`: build `./shishua`.
- `make test`: run performance tests, PractRand, and BigCrush on SHISHUA.
- `make test/benchmark-seed`: run seed correlation test.
- `make test/benchmark-perf`: run performance comparison locally.
- `make benchmark-intel`: run performance comparison on a GCP Intel chip.
- `make benchmark-amd`: run performance comparison on a GCP AMD chip.
- `make benchmark-arm`: run performance comparison on an AWS Graviton ARM chip.
